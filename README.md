  > Somebody once told me: keep learning no matter what :) 

  > I was studying for the Google Cloud Digital Leader Exam. Here is my study path that I designed and followed to pass the exam :)


## Recommendations
```
Some recommendations that worked for me:
  - I took notes of acronyms meaning and names of services. In most cases, these names have a relation with the objective of the service. So using my background and logic I solved some questions!
  - I took notes of little details that I considered important or hard to remember. In this way, when I was learning, I could go back and I had a chance to remember the notes with just a quick look.
  - I read the requirements, rules, times, numbers of questions related to the exam! I didn't want to lose the exam for not being on time.
  - I completed the courses available in Coursera. See the links below:
    -- Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud
    -- Innovating with Data and Google Cloud
    -- Application and infrastructure modernization with Google Cloud
    -- Understanding Google Cloud Security and Operations
    -- Google Cloud Practitioner Essentials. 
  - I tried some Google Cloud practitioner sample questions.
  - I read about identity, networking, pricing model, conditions of service support.
  - I tried the simulation tests in [Whizlabs] y [Pluralsight]. They are paid, but free trial versions work well.
  - I attended the online exam, so I chose my home with the supervision of a remote person.
  - Finally, I tried to sleep well the previous day and after the exam and I enjoyed a ice cream when I receive the results!
  If you don't pass the exam, there is always a solution. Although you have to pay again, it is not game over!

 Consider following this roadmap and mark each step when you finish!
